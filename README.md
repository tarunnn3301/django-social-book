# Social-Book

Social-Book is a Full Stack Chatting App.

I've developed a feature-rich social media app using Django, providing users with a seamless experience. The app includes standard features like signup, login, and account settings. Users can easily upload posts, create a personalized feed, and engage with content through likes. The profile page showcases user information, while the follow/unfollow feature fosters connections. The app also ensures an updated post feed, supports image downloads, and simplifies user search. Additionally, user suggestions enhance discoverability. In summary, this Django-based social media app combines essential functionalities to create a dynamic and engaging online community.
